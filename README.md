# PWA_Draftly

This week's challenge is to develop a text editor that can be accessed through a browser. The application must meet the criteria of a Progressive Web App (PWA) and should feature several data persistence techniques as a fallback option in case the browser does not support any of them. Moreover, the app should work offline.
